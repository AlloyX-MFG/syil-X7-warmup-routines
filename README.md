# Breakin Requirements - First Spindle Run - Run-In
The following routine is a breakin routine in the SYl X7 User Guide.  
See User Manual section 25.17 for a list of each

# Warmup Routine
Before using the machine each day the spindle requires a warmup procedure.  Our procedure uses the recommended spindle speeds and times stamped on the front of the spindle.  In addition we run a pattern on the X and Y (table) to warm up the other motors.  The following routines are for idle time that has passed since last using the machine.  

## 24 hours since last run

## 72 Hours since last run

## 2 weeks idle
